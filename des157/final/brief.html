                    <p> This project will explore the world of skincare and attempt to remove the misconception that only clear, perfect skin is beautiful. </p>

                <h2>Comparison Project 2</h2>   
                    <p>
                        I think Curology’s website is well designed because its sections are distinctly laid out and the elements don’t feel cluttered or overwhelming. The hero section is simple, yet effective with the large hero image and the word that changes out every few seconds. The color palette is simple in order to stay true with its branding, but I really enjoy the pops of color that are used throughout as well. The images they use are big and make a statement to emphasize their product and how well it works for their customers, which works effectively. Because the user has to scroll for a while to get to the end, there is a call to action button to get a free trial that is repeated 3 times on the homepage alone, which seems very repetitive. In order to reduce the redundancy, links to sections on the homepage could perhaps be helpful.

                <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
                <p>Overall, I want the design to look clean and elegant. Much like Curology, I want to use an engaging hero section to capture attention, while also making clear and distinct sections for my content. To stick to the natural nature of skincare, I want to embody that in my colors as well, sticking to muted, earthy tones. To keep things looking classy, I would also want to use a nice serif display font and have an effective use of typography and images to create an engaging balance. I don’t want things to look too cluttered or overwhelming, which is why organization will be vital for my design to be effective.

                <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
                <p>When a viewer looks at my site, I hope that they feel calm and at ease. Using a neutral and muted color palette is one way to do so, as well as keeping elements on the page properly organized. Keeping everything looking clean and simple is also another way to achieve the calming effect. One of my goals is also to send a message about skincare and beauty and how to feel confident in one’s skin. So throughout my project, I hope to guide the user through my experience using story-telling and including words of affirmation to make them feel more comfortable.

                <h2>Comparison Project 1</h2>              
                        <p>
                            The Klog’s interface uses nice, almost pastel colors in their color palette that is engaging and is what catches my eyes the most. The orange and green work well together as the primary colors, and the pop of yellow is a nice touch. Although the colors are engaging, I would have liked to see more interesting interactions on the page. There are some slight micro-interactions with animation easing, but I think something more dramatic could increase audience engagement. The most obvious interaction is this mouse hover interaction over each article in which the cursor changes to a small green dot, but it can sometimes be hard to see and hinders the user experience a bit. The website has a lot of information and articles to refer to in order to learn more about a certain topic, but doesn’t do a great job chunking information into evident categories of content.                         </p>

                <h2>Project Goals</h2>   
                <p>My project is similar to both sites in the sense that I will address skin concerns as well as including products that have worked for me and helped me throughout my skincare journey. The overall goal is to not only introduce my skincare routine to my audience, but also empower people who feel insecure about their skin and reassure them that blemished skin is healthy too. It differs from both sites because the sole purpose is not to sell a product, but to inform my audience about the beauty of skincare and how it can make others feel confidence in their skin as well. I want to emphasize the journey to self-love and feeling more confident above all else.    </p>

                <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
                <p> I hope to rely on subtle interactions, such as easing of elements and fades to provide a small, but effective design. I thought that the timed event on Curology’s hero section was also really fun, and I would love to incorporate that into my design as well. My project won’t rely too heavily on intense or dramatic interactions, but micro-interactions used in the images and text to heighten the overall experience. This would include animating images on hover, and playing with elements on the page on scroll, and some fun animations on the type treatment.
