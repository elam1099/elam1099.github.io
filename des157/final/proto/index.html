            <p> For me, my skincare routine is a sign of peace, both in the morning and in the evening. In the morning, it wakes me up and prepares my skin for the day, signifying a time of peace and comfort before taking on the day. Above all else, it is a reminder that perfect skin isn't everything, but what is most important is feeling beautiful from the inside.</p>

    <p>I end my night by spending some time on self care. The last few minutes before going to bed are spent prepping my skin so that it can repair overnight, as well as a peaceful reflection of my day. I think it's important to reserve some time of your day in order to take care of yourself and well-being.</p>

            <p>Two to three times a week, I use this AHA (Alpha Hyroxy Acid) toner from Krave Beauty to help exfoliate my skin and make way for new skin cells to form. This helps to remove any impurities and brighten the skin.</p>
            <img id="toner" src="images/toner.png" width =200 alt="bottle of serum">
            <p>My favorite toner of all time is this one from Son & Park (I've been using it for 4 years!) It mildly exfoliates and brightens the skin, creating smoother skin texture, while being very gentle. Definitely one of my holy grail products!</p>
            <img id="snail" src = "images/snail.png" width= 200 alt= "bottle of serum">
            <p>I use this snail essence (yes, snail!) from COSRX to help mainstain moisture and repair any damaged skin. It's one of the very first products I incorporated into my skincare routine and remains to be a staple in my collection.</p>
            <img id="blume" src = "images/blume.png" width= 200 alt= "bottle of serum">
            <p>This skincare oil from Blume is one of the products that transformed my skin! This oil is made of all-natural ingredients, and although it's an oil, it doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy at all and has great acne fighting properties.</p>
            <img id="tret" src = "images/tret.png" width= 200 alt= "tube of lotion">
            <p>I use a tretinoin cream, which is essentially an acne cream, a few times a week (on days when I am not using my AHA toner). Tretinoin is a product that can be very drying, causing the skin to peel so that new skin can form. I get my prescription from my dermotologist.</p>

        <p>On days I don't use an AHA toner, I mix this vitamin C powder from NeoGen in my everyday toner. I like using vitamin C in a powder form because they do not oxidize and lose its effectiveness like they do in a liquid form. </p>
        <p>My favorite toner of all time is this one from Son & Park (I've been using it for 4 years!) It mildly exfoliates and brightens the skin, creating smoother skin texture, while being very gentle. Definitely one of my holy grail products!</p>
        <p>To add an extra boost of hydration, I use this ampoule from Skin 1004. This product contains centella asiatica, which is a great hydrating ingredient that helps to soothe irritation in the skin.</p>

        <p>This serum from Peach and Lily helps to achieve "glass skin," which is a desired look in Asian beauty meaning skin that is clear and translucent like glass. It has great ingredients, like niacinimide, to brighten and even out the skin. </p>

            <p>On days where I wear makeup, I use this cleansing oil from The Face Shop before my regular cleanser. Oil cleansers break down makeup much easier and make for a better wash when paired with a foaming cleanser. </p>
            <img id="innisfree" src = "images/innisfree.png" width= 200 alt= "bottle of serum"></a>
            <p>This green tea serum from Innisfree is another really good and hydrating product.  I use this to prep my skin before makeup, as I find that it provides a nice and smooth base, while also making my skin feel plump.</p>
            <img id="cetaphil" src = "images/cetaphil.png" width= 200 alt= "bottle of cleanser"></a>
            <p>I use this cleanser from Cetaphil everyday in the shower to wash my face, and have been using it for almost a decade!. I love it because it's a really gentle cleanser and does the job without making my skin feel dry after using it.</p>

            <p>Acne patches are lifesavers when it comes to treating a pimple. These CORSX pimple patches are made from hydrocolloid, which create a moist enviroinment to promote healing. When used on a pimple, it pulls out all the impurities and quickens the healing of the pimple.</p>

        <p>I use the AHA/BHA solution from The Ordinary only about twice a month since it is a chemical exfoliant and can make the skin super sensitive. This is definitely a more extreme product, but results in smoother and newer skin.</p>

        <p>When I feel like my pores are congested and full of blackheads, I use this pore clay mask from Innisfree about once a week. After using it, I definitely see a difference in my pores without having to squeeze and pull on my skin.</p>

        <p>Every so often when I really want to treat myself, I use this honey mask from the brand, "I'm from." Honey is a really great ingredient for your skin, as it hydrates and softens the skin barrier. Every time I use it, my skin feels baby smooth.</p>

        <p>These pimple patches from The Klog are made of the same material as the ones from COSRX, except I like these when I wear them out in public since they're almost invisible on the skin. I like to use the COSRX ones at night or at home because they're more obvious.</p>
