    <h1>Sources for audio</h1>

    <p>All game noises for buttons were taken from Mixkit.co.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/game/">"Unlock game notification"</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/game/?page=2">""Game bonus reached"</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The dice roll sound was a sound I made by recording the sound of dice using my phone.</p>
