        <h2>"Best practices for form design"</h2>
            <h3>Entry 1</h3>
                <p>This article was particularly helpful in helping me understand how to properly create a form that is accessible and user friendly. Reading through the article made me realize how small adjustments to the form, such as matching the keyboard to the form input content, or creating a one column form, can drastically improve the user experience. As someone who has filled out many forms before, I found that the most effective ones had most of the qualities that were explained in the article. Filling out forms can often be a tedious process, so the suggestions that the author made such as showing a progress bar and only asking relevant questions can greatly improve the user’s experience with the form, which in turn, encourages them to complete it. </p>
                <p> When creating a form, it’s more than a matter of just collecting information, but rather the overall journey that the user goes through to complete it. If the form is too difficult or confusing to complete, the user will not complete it. By making the form as user friendly as possible, users will have an easy time to complete it, which benefits both parties involved -- those who are giving information and those who are receiving the information. The article really made me rethink the way that I have previously made forms, and many of the helpful tips are definitely things that I will refer back to the next time I make a form. </p>
