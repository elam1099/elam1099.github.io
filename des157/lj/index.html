            <h2>"10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills"</h2>
                <h3>Entry 3</h3>
                    <p>When perusing the Awwwards website, the first website that really stood out to me was this site called Umami Land. It’s an interactive site that gives a virtual tour of Japanese food, which is very fitting considering the circumstances of the pandemic. The word “umami” is a Japanese term that is used to describe something savory, and can often be considered a fifth flavor profile (alongside sweet, sour, salty, and bitter). I thought it was a super fun and playful concept through the use of its very “kawaii” images and music that plays when you’re on the site. </p>
                    <p>On the site, you’re able to click on these images of food and learn more about the cuisine. Once you click on a food item, it redirects you to a Google search for that particular food so that the user can learn more about the item, as well as find restaurants near them that may serve it.The interactivity and sounds make it seem like you’re playing a video game, which is much more engaging and encourages users to learn. The more you learn, the more badges you get for learning as well. Overall, I think it’s a very cute concept that brings the knowledge of Japanese food to you in an interactive and fun way, right from the comfort of your device.

            <h2>"Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows"</h2>
                <h3>Entry 2</h3>
                    <p>I thought this article on modals was particularly interesting, as it revealed a lot of pain points that I have experienced with them that I never really thought about before. After reading the article, it made me realize how badly so many modals are designed because almost every time I see one, I immediately want to click out of it. Now that I’ve acknowledged it as a problem when designing overlays, I can take many of the tips into consideration and create a modal that is more user friendly. Surely, these modals do grab my attention, but most of the time, they pop up when I least expect it, which disrupts my user experience and causes more annoyance than helpfulness.</p>
                    <p>I also thought that it was important to note that many people do not perceive modals positively, due to their previous bad experiences with poorly designed overlays. Because they have a poor reputation in terms of its user experience, it’s important to recognize its shortcomings and evaluate whether or not the overlay is the most effective design choice. Overlays can definitely be powerful in grasping the user’s attention and simplifying the UI, but only if they are designed effectively in a way that does not hinder the user’s experience. Overall, I thought the article had some really helpful tips that I can see myself utilizing to create overlays that work for users like me.</p>

            <h2>"Best practices for form design"</h2>
                <h3>Entry 1</h3>
                    <p>This article was particularly helpful in helping me understand how to properly create a form that is accessible and user friendly. Reading through the article made me realize how small adjustments to the form, such as matching the keyboard to the form input content, or creating a one column form, can drastically improve the user experience. As someone who has filled out many forms before, I found that the most effective ones had most of the qualities that were explained in the article. Filling out forms can often be a tedious process, so the suggestions that the author made such as showing a progress bar and only asking relevant questions can greatly improve the user’s experience with the form, which in turn, encourages them to complete it. </p>
                    <p> When creating a form, it’s more than a matter of just collecting information, but rather the overall journey that the user goes through to complete it. If the form is too difficult or confusing to complete, the user will not complete it. By making the form as user friendly as possible, users will have an easy time to complete it, which benefits both parties involved -- those who are giving information and those who are receiving the information. The article really made me rethink the way that I have previously made forms, and many of the helpful tips are definitely things that I will refer back to the next time I make a form. </p>
